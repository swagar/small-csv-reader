# small-csv-reader

This is my csv reader which I often usen when I quickly need to read a csv file for some tools or so. In that case I don't need all the functionalities that [jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text) or [boon provides](https://github.com/boonproject/boon). 

This library is very small. It has just one single class and no dependencies. Currently it is not optimsed for speed. Maybe I will change this in the future if I need to or I do like to. But right now its fast enough. 

Feel free to add more feature or change it as you like.
